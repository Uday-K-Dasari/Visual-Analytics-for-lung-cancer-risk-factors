# Visual-Analytics-for-lung-cancer-risk-factors

Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, necessitating early detection and prevention efforts. This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of health and lifestyle factors to predict the likelihood of lung cancer. By leveraging machine learning models and statistical analysis, the project aims to identify significant predictors and provide interpretable insights for lung cancer detection.

The key objectives of this project are:
To explore and preprocess the dataset to ensure data quality.
To utilize advanced machine learning models (Logistic Regression, SVM, and XGBoost) to predict lung cancer occurrences.
To evaluate the performance of these models and identify key risk factors using SHAP analysis.
To compare the significance of model performance using statistical tests.
